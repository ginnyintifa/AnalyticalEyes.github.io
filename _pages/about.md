I am a computational biologist/bioinformatician working at a Pharmaceutical company. From July 2021 to May 2023 I received postdoc training from the one and only <a href ='https://www.nesvilab.org/'> Nesvi lab</a> at the University of Michigan. 
I process, analyze, integrate and visualize multi-omics data including transcriptomics and proteomics data. I believe there is a way to understand disease such as cancer with data. By leveraging advanced computational techniques, I strive to contribute to our understanding of disease mechanisms and facilitate the development of innovative therapeutic approaches.
